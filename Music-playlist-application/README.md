#Music Playlist App

This folder contains console application that simulates a song playlist app using core concepts of object-oriented-programming. 

The application allows users to list menu options, list all available songs, play a song, replay the current song, play the next song, play the previous song and delete current song.

I implemented Linked List data structure to keep track of the songs in the playlist.
